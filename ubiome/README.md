Using the Ubiome Python Library
---

uBiome is a citizen science company that collects and analyzes samples of the human microbiome. Send them your sample and they will process it using the information contained in the 16S subregion of the bacterial genome and send you the results.

Advanced users have access to the raw data, including the original FASTQ files from uBiome's Illumina NextSeq500 machine as well as a JSON-encapsulated summary of the results.

This library will help you look at the JSON summary.

Until we have more documentation written, please see the [ubiome-example](microbiome-tools/ubiome_example.py) to see how this works.

The following classes let you manipulate the uBiome taxonomy data:

*UbiomeSample*


*UbiomeDiffSample*

*UbiomeMultiSample*


'UbiomeDiffSample','UbiomeMultiSample'
